## 文字格式

It's very easy to make some words **粗体** and other words *斜体* with Markdown. You can even [到 Google 的链接!](http://google.com)

## list

数字列表

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

符号列表©️

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

还可以缩进

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

## 引用

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway

## 代码

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

## 拓展 

GitHub supports many extras in Markdown that help you reference and link to people. If you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with an @ symbol: Hey @kneath — love your sweater!

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item

When you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will see a helpful progress bar in your list of issues. It works in Pull Requests, too!

And, of course emoji!
